        <p>I have a wide range of interests that keep life vibrant and fulfilling. I love to cook, experimenting with new recipes and flavors in the kitchen, which is both a creative outlet and a source of joy. Gardening is another passion of mine, allowing me to connect with nature and cultivate beauty right in my backyard. In my downtime, I enjoy watching movies and consuming various forms of media, from books to podcasts, which provide endless opportunities for entertainment and learning. Additionally, I am deeply interested in pursuing a career in technology, particularly in software development, as it combines my love for problem-solving with my drive for continuous learning. These hobbies not only enrich my life but also offer a balance to my professional pursuits and responsibilities.</p>
